# Thermal_Pose
Privacy and Security go hand in hand. Having a camera everywhere is a good solution
to many problems but it also brings about privacy concerns. This concern can be
somewhat alleviated when you replace the camera with thermal imaging sensors.
The aim of this project is to use thermal imaging in a way that it can remove the need
for RGB cameras.
Thermal Images have been around for quite some time now but they still lack the
functionality that is observed in RGB images.
So, in this project we are trying to detect a person and then estimate whether a person
is drunk or not given a thermal image.
